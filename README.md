# Data-Analytics-Pathway-Assessment
This project centers on analyzing a bank marketing dataset to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and campaign-related features. The dataset originates from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. By exploring patterns and trends in the data, the goal is to uncover key factors influencing customer decisions and support future targeting strategies.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Identify trends and influential features affecting subscription rates
- Analyze customer demographics and campaign responses
- Build insights to guide predictive modeling (e.g., classification)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas – for data handling and manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for insightful visualizations
- NumPy – for numerical processing
- Scikit-learn (recommended for future modeling)

## Key Analyses Performed
- Target Variable Analysis: Explored the distribution of customers who subscribed (yes) vs those who did not (no).
- Demographic Exploration: Analyzed how age, job, marital status, and education relate to subscription likelihood.
- Campaign Effectiveness: Assessed the impact of contact methods, timing, and frequency on subscription outcomes.
- Correlation Analysis: Visualized relationships between numerical variables such as balance, duration, and previous contacts.

## Insights
- The majority of customers do not subscribe to a term deposit; the data is imbalanced.
- Contact duration strongly correlates with subscription success; longer calls often lead to positive outcomes.
- Education and job type play a significant role in the likelihood of subscribing.
- Certain months and contact types (e.g., cellular) result in better conversion rates.
